# Python_Game

This is a text based game. The setting is a user running around a house assembling a weapon to use for combat against a burglar that has broken in the house. 


The following text is the introductory paragraph when user starts up game:

                   " ****Welcome to Protect and Serve!****
                    
A burgler has broken into your home, where you now have to protect yourself! But oh no you now find yourself having
to assemble your weapon! Run around your house and find the parts that you need to build protection!"



User starts in a room and is given a number of commands and possibilities to move in different directions. There are a number of possibilities but every time
the user moves into a different room, there is a weapon part on the floor and the user must decide whether he wants to use pick it up or not. Take caution as
if the user walks into the same room as the burglar before having the weapon completely built together then the user would lose the game. 

This game utilizes dictionaries to keep track of weapon parts and building, rooms, and where the burglar is. There are conditionals that ask if you want to pick up the 
weapon part or not. 
The room map is built through a dictionary with the room as key, and every possible direction as a value. 

Thank you,
